# LargeLanguageMadness
Hi, I am new to the Large Language Model space and just wanted to share things that I learn along the way\

Here are some of the things that I have written so far
1. A `BytePairEncoder` that helps in encoding tokens in a sub-word token system
2. A Bigram Language Model where the tokens are just characters.
3. A complete `Transformer` with `MultiHeadedAttention` and `Encoder`, `Decoder` block
